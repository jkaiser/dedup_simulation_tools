The "generator" takes the deduplication traces as collected by Dutch Meyer et. al and converts them into the traces as the fs-c tool from Dirk Meister would create them (github.com/dmeister/fs-c). The latter is the input format for the deduplication simulator.

The conversion uses metadata from Meyer's files. These are given in the all_file_metadata.txt file.
